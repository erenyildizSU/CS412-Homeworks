## HW4 – Transfer Learning on CelebA

**Objective:** Perform binary gender classification using a pre-trained **VGG-16** model on the **CelebA** dataset.

- Dataset: 30,000 celebrity face images with gender labels
- Data split: 80% train, 10% validation, 10% test
- Two training strategies:
  1. Freeze all convolutional layers, train only classifier head
  2. Fine-tune last conv block + classifier head
- Two learning rates: 0.001 and 0.0001
- Evaluation metrics: Accuracy, Confusion Matrix
- Visualization of training loss, accuracy, and misclassified samples
